# Notes on Calisthenics Training (User)

### Week 1–4: Foundation Plan

- Frog Stand: 3 sets x 15 reps → good control, but need to work on balance.
- Pike Hold: 3 sets x 20 reps → solid core and shoulders.
- Wall Handstand: 3 sets x 15 reps → need more time in freestanding.

### Week 5–8: Freestanding Handstand Progression

- Freestanding Handstand: 3 sets x 10 reps → good balance, but need to work on endurance.
- Wall Handstand Push-up: 3 sets x 15 reps → solid shoulders and core.

### Week 9–12: Advanced Calisthenics

- Handstand Push-up (with support): 3 sets x 15 reps → strong shoulders and control.
- Pike Push-up (with control): 3 sets x 20 reps → good core strength.

## Goals:

✅ Master freestanding handstand in 3–4 months  
✅ Do clean pike push-ups with control  
✅ Build shoulder and core strength for advanced movements

---

## Strengths:

- Light bodyweight (66kg) → huge advantage
- Strong shoulders and wrists early on
- Good body awareness → you feel what works and adjust
- You train smart, not recklessly
- You enjoy training → this is the biggest predictor of success

## What Will Hold You Back?

⚠️ Skipping leg work long-term  
⚠️ Too many max-effort handstand attempts  
⚠️ Not eating enough calories  
⚠️ Training every day without recovery  

→ You avoided most of these already — good.

## Long-Term Potential (Straight Talk)

With your build and mindset, you can realistically reach:

✅ Strong freestanding handstand  
✅ Handstand Push-ups  
✅ Advanced calisthenics control (clean, not flashy)  
✅ Balanced, athletic physique  
✅ High strength-to-weight ratio

You are built for this style of training.

## Final Coach Verdict

You’re not “trying calisthenics.”  
You’re already doing it correctly.

If you stay consistent for a year:  
→ People will assume you’ve been training for years.  
→ No shortcuts needed. Just consistency.
